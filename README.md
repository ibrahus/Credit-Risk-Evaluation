# Credit-Risk-Evaluation
Credit risk evaluation is regarded to be the most important problem in financial institutions. This project proposes a credit risk evaluation system by using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan or not and to predict their probability of default. Using tuned machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we built models for detecting defaults. The models have been trained using Australian credit approval datasets in [UCI machine learning database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(australian+credit+approval)). The results show that, XGBoost model has the best overall performance compared to other models used in this project. Setting a threshold which ensures the maximum estimated value in the credit portfolio to classify new samples based on the predicted probability of default will improve the performance of the models and maximize the credit portfolio value for the financial institutions.
